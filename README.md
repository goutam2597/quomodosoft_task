# Project Structure Overview

This Flutter project is organized using a **feature-first** folder structure for scalability and clarity.

## 📁 Folder Breakdown

- **lib/app/**: App-wide configurations including colors, themes, and asset paths.
- **lib/features/**: Divided by features (`auth`, `home`, `products`, `common`) and each feature contains:
  - `data/` - for dummy/mock data or later services/repositories
  - `ui/screens/` - for screen widgets
  - `ui/widgets/` - for reusable widgets within the feature
- **main.dart**: Entry point of the application.

## ✅ Strengths
- Clean separation by feature makes scaling and maintenance easier.
- Reusable widgets are clearly scoped within their features.

## 🛠️ Suggestions for Improvement
- Move `product_widget.dart` from `features/products/widgets/` to `features/products/ui/widgets/` for consistency.
- Add `domain/` folders under each feature (e.g., `features/home/domain/`) for models and business logic if the app grows.
- Add `services/` or `repository/` under `data/` if you're integrating APIs.
- Move `common/` outside `features/` if it’s truly shared globally across many features.

## 🧱 Possible Clean Architecture Layout (Optional Upgrade)

_This structure balances clarity for small-to-medium apps, while being easily extendable into Clean Architecture for larger projects._
